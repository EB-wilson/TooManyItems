## TooManyItems Developer Guide

This guide aims to provide help and reference for mod developers adapting TooManyItems (such as recipe registration, item type registration, etc.) to quickly achieve compatibility with recipes for custom factories and other content in your mod.

Note: If all the content in your mod uses vanilla content types from Mindustry (such as GenericCrafter, etc.) and you have not made any custom overrides related to the recipes, the recipe parsing process for these contents has been already implemented so you do not have to manually register them.
